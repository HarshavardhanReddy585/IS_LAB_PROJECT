# Threat Model and Security Analysis

## Overview

This document analyzes the security properties, threats, and limitations of the Secure Chat with PFS implementation.

## Security Goals

### Primary Goals
1. **Confidentiality**: Messages cannot be read by unauthorized parties
2. **Forward Secrecy**: Past messages remain secure even if keys are compromised
3. **Integrity**: Messages cannot be modified without detection
4. **Authenticity**: Messages are verified to be from claimed sender (within session)

### Non-Goals
- **Anonymity**: This system does not hide user identities
- **Deniability**: Message sender can be proven
- **Availability**: No DoS protection implemented
- **Key authentication**: No public key infrastructure or certificate validation

## Threat Actors

### 1. Passive Network Attacker
**Capabilities:**
- Monitor all network traffic
- Capture encrypted messages
- Analyze traffic patterns

**Protections:**
- ✓ End-to-end encryption (AES-256-GCM)
- ✓ Cannot decrypt without session key
- ✓ Cannot derive session key without private key

**Limitations:**
- ⚠ Metadata visible (sender, receiver, timing, size)
- ⚠ Traffic patterns analyzable

### 2. Compromised Server
**Capabilities:**
- Read all messages passing through server
- Modify messages
- Drop messages
- Inject fake messages

**Protections:**
- ✓ Server sees only ciphertext (untrusted relay design)
- ✓ AES-GCM authentication prevents modification
- ✓ Message tampering detected via auth tag

**Limitations:**
- ⚠ Server can perform denial-of-service
- ⚠ Server can lie about user list
- ⚠ No protection against dropped messages

### 3. Retrospective Attacker (Key Compromise)
**Capabilities:**
- Captures all encrypted traffic
- Later obtains current session key

**Protections:**
- ✓ **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Old keys destroyed after ratchet
- ✓ Old messages encrypted with old key (now gone)
- ✓ Cannot decrypt historical messages

**Limitations:**
- ⚠ Messages sent AFTER compromise are readable
- ⚠ No protection if ALL ratchet history captured

### 4. Active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)
**Capabilities:**
- Intercept initial key exchange
- Replace public keys with own keys
- Decrypt and re-encrypt messages

**Protections:**
- ⚠ **VULNERABLE**: No certificate authority
- ⚠ **VULNERABLE**: No key pinning
- ⚠ **VULNERABLE**: No out-of-band verification

**Mitigations:**
- Manual fingerprint comparison (out-of-band)
- Trust on first use (TOFU) model

### 5. Endpoint Compromise
**Capabilities:**
- Access to plaintext messages
- Access to current keys
- Keylogger capabilities

**Protections:**
- ✗ **NO PROTECTION**: Assume endpoints are secure

**Mitigations:**
- Operating system security
- Antivirus software
- Physical security

## Cryptographic Components

### X25519 ECDH
**Security Level:** 128-bit (equivalent to 3072-bit RSA)

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Efficient key exchange
- ✓ Widely reviewed and standardized (RFC 7748)
- ✓ Resistant to side-channel attacks

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠ No authentication of public keys
- ⚠ Vulnerable to MITM during exchange

### HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)
**Hash:** SHA-256

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Properly expands shared secret
- ✓ Includes context (session ID, ratchet count)
- ✓ Salt prevents rainbow table attacks

**Weaknesses:**
- None (when used correctly)

### AES-256-GCM
**Key Size:** 256 bits  
**Nonce Size:** 12 bytes (96 bits)

**Strengths:**
- ✓ Authenticated encryption (confidentiality + integrity)
- ✓ 256-bit keys (post-quantum secure against Grover's algorithm)
- ✓ Random nonces prevent replay

**Weaknesses:**
- ⚠ Nonce reuse would be catastrophic (mitigated by random generation)
- ⚠ No message ordering protection

## Attack Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Passive Eavesdropping
```
Attacker: Captures all network traffic
Goal: Read message "Secret meeting at noon"

Attack:
1. Capture encrypted JSON
2. Extract ciphertext: "x7K9mP3n..."
3. Attempt decryption

Result: FAILURE
- No access to session key
- AES-256 brute force infeasible
- Cannot derive key without private key
```

### Scenario 2: Key Compromise (Forward Secrecy Test)
```
Attacker: Obtains current session key K2
Goal: Decrypt old message encrypted with K1

Attack:
1. Have ciphertext C1 (encrypted with K1)
2. Obtain current key K2
3. Attempt decrypt(C1, K2)

Result: FAILURE
- K1 was destroyed during ratchet
- K2 cannot decrypt C1
- Perfect Forward Secrecy protects old messages
```

### Scenario 3: Active MITM
```
Attacker: Intercept key exchange between Alice and Bob
Goal: Read all messages

Attack:
1. Alice sends public_key_A to Bob
2. Attacker intercepts, replaces with public_key_M
3. Attacker intercepts Bob's public_key_B
4. Attacker replaces with different public_key_M'
5. Attacker now has separate sessions with both

Result: SUCCESS (in this implementation)
- No certificate validation
- No key pinning
- No out-of-band verification required

Mitigation:
- Users must manually compare key fingerprints
- Fingerprints displayed in UI: "A1B2C3D4..."
- Compare via phone call or in person
```

### Scenario 4: Message Modification
```
Attacker: Try to modify encrypted message
Goal: Change "Yes" to "No"

Attack:
1. Intercept ciphertext + auth tag
2. Flip bits in ciphertext
3. Forward to recipient

Result: FAILURE
- GCM authentication tag validation fails
- Recipient detects tampering
- Message rejected
```

### Scenario 5: Replay Attack
```
Attacker: Capture valid encrypted message
Goal: Re-send old message

Attack:
1. Capture message M1 with nonce N1
2. Replay M1 later

Result: PARTIAL SUCCESS
- Message decrypts (no ordering protection)
- Random nonces prevent pattern detection
- But no sequence numbers to detect replay

Mitigation Needed:
- Add message sequence numbers
- Reject out-of-order messages
```

## Implementation Vulnerabilities

### 1. MITM During Initial Key Exchange
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Complete compromise of confidentiality

**Fix:**
```python
# Add out-of-band verification
def verify_key_fingerprint(peer_fingerprint: str) -> bool:
    """User must confirm peer's fingerprint matches"""
    print(f"Peer fingerprint: {peer_fingerprint}")
    response = input("Does this match? (yes/no): ")
    return response.lower() == 'yes'
```

### 2. No Message Sequence Numbers
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** Replay attacks possible

**Fix:**
```python
# Add to message structure
{
    'sequence': 123,  # Monotonic counter
    'encrypted': {...}
}

# Reject if sequence <= last_seen_sequence
```

### 3. No Rate Limiting
**Severity:** MEDIUM  
**Impact:** DoS via message flooding

**Fix:**
```python
# Add to server
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_per_second=10):
        self.limits = {}  # client -> (count, timestamp)
```

### 4. Hardcoded Auto-Ratchet Interval
**Severity:** LOW  
**Impact:** Predictable ratcheting

**Fix:**
```python
# Add jitter
import random
ratchet_at = base_interval + random.randint(-5, 5)
```

### 5. No Key Verification UI
**Severity:** HIGH  
**Impact:** Users don't verify keys

**Fix:**
- Add prominent warning on first connection
- Require user acknowledgment
- Show QR code for easy comparison

   - Encrypt keys at rest
   - Secure memory clearing

6. **Logging and monitoring**
   - Audit logs for security events
   - Anomaly detection
   - Alert on suspicious activity

### Nice to Have
7. **Double ratcheting** (like Signal)

## Conclusion

This implementation provides:
- ✓ Strong confidentiality (AES-256-GCM)
- ✓ Perfect Forward Secrecy (key ratcheting)
- ✓ Integrity protection (authenticated encryption)
- ✓ Educational demonstration value

But lacks:
- ✗ Key authentication (vulnerable to MITM)
